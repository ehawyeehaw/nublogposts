## Founder Spotlight

#### Chris Jaramillo

Howdy all, I'm a US Navy Veteran with an appetite for adventure. My time with the US Navy Special Warfare community completely changed my entire perspective and opened my eyes to the true possibilities of life. In addition, my experiences at Rescue Swimmer School deeply ingrained my mindset to adopt resiliency, humbleness and absolute tenacity towards my goals.

Post military service, I'd continued on at the University of Washington as an aspiring Entrepreneur. Being surrounded by great minds inspired me to push myself even further to wear multiple hats, one of those eventually being the hat of a Software Engineer.

Four years and some change, here we are.

## Why Gremolina?

> There's tons of innovative and popular apps serving the same purpose already, what makes you any different?

### Community

We're building Gremolina with community at the forefront, as it stands, there isn't an app or product that we use regularly that fosters the connection we're looking for. Trust me, we've tried them all during the lulls of the pandemic and not much has changed since. Sure, we've seen a newer nameless competitor pop up, yet it still lacks the element of connection we're seeking.

We want users to make real connections long term and in the same sense, Gremolina can also be a place where travelers can pick up and go to something fun at a whims notice!

In addition, we're building features to help users rate the validity of events and also, be able to showcase their participation to events with an achievements system. We're going to Gamify the experience, if you will.

### UI / UX

We believe the platform should be as fun and creative as its user base, splashes of color, personality and simple to use! We want all users to easily be able to post and share their events without overcomplicating the process, built with simplicity with effectiveness towards real engagement/turn out. Whether your a participant of events, small business, midsize, or large business, we want to cultivate an experience that serves all. 

### Next Steps

We've been currently running successful beta periods testing different variations of our platform and have clear direction for the road ahead. We anticipate a Summer 2024 Web launch, with IOS and Android following shortly after.

### Perks of Contributing:

At Gremolina we're very excited about launch and we would like for you to be as well. With that being said, we want to give back to those who have contributed to our cause.

Every contribution made will receive a personalized thank you email and you will also be entered in our raffle to win a $500 gift card of your choice, held every $10k. The goal tracker will be updated weekly and raffle winners will be notified via email.
