## Insights From My Journey In Tech (so far)

<Video id="ES4nqCYdWOU" />

The Tech industry has changed quite a bit since the glory days, where it seemed as if anyone with a computer and a coding bootcamp certificate was enough to join a team!

### Present Day

We are far from those days and this may be the new norm with no end in sight. What now? Perhaps this is not particularly a bad thing, it is forcing us all to upskill and take our profession much more seriously. Which, helps the business we're apart of and thus promising more job security for all involved.

### How Can You Grow As A Junior Dev?

1. Take Initiative

This is not meant to state the obvious, yet to highlight that persistent and consistent efforts will showcase your motivation/dedication towards your craft. For example, look at your projects that you're building (I hope you're building) and put them up against what it is already out there. Does it vary at all? If a hiring manager looked at multiple candidates submitting similar projects, would they differ at all? What would make yours that much more than the other? Add unique features, themes, personality and showcase who you are as a developer.

Now, this isn't meant to scare you and push you into a room full of sharky competition. Although, when you're joining brilliant teams, you must at some point expect to be pushed to an entirely new level don't you? Why wait until that time? Refine your skills now, while you can have the luxury of building at your pace.

Trust me, you will miss the peace and quiet of your junior days. Don't rush the process, learn what excites you and you will get there in time.

2. Discipline

Again, perhaps stating the obvious, yet it must be said. Practice discipline, not only as it pertains to Software Engineering, but in many facets of your life.

Take health and wellness for example, staying committed to a routine every day can transfer to other areas of your life. Not a fitness nut? How about a book club? Staying consistent and reading every night can also transfer onto your programming life, you may find yourself beginning to read more documentation than before. 

Without discipline, it may be very difficult to stay focused and committed to your short/long term goals.

3. Mentorship

One of my favorite stories to tell is, how I'd coded alone in a dark room for years before ever speaking to anyone else about programming. You guessed it, I was pretty terrible at conveying my chain of thought in a room with other versed Software Engineers. From then on, I'd realized that I'd needed to seek out mentorship and learn what it is that I don't know.

> How do you know what you don't know?

Well, fact is you don't most times. Seek mentorship and be humble, most people are happy to help if you can showcase you're serious. Ps, please respect someone's time if they have offered it to as a benefit to you.

4. Communication

Above all, I feel that communication is key at every level during your Tech career. No matter if you're a junior or a CTO, there must be a mutual level of understanding between all individuals involved. A business cannot operate without cohesive communication. 

As programmers, I know this may not be our first desirable skill to work on, yet it is so crucial for growth. Collaborative thought is so powerful and even more so under strict time deadlines, push yourself to grow at this skill as soon as possible!

### In Conclusion

I hope you have enjoyed my perspective on the matter and it is my hope that these tips will help you in your journey! Remember, anything worthwhile will take time. Consistent and persistent efforts will get you there.

Most importantly, don't forget to practice, practice, practice!
