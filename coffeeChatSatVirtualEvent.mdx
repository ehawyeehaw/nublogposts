Howdy all, join West LA Coding for a power hour of virtual networking! 

#### Agenda:

Host Introduction: 

We’ll begin with a brief overview of our new event series and what we hope to transpire over the course of the next few weeks with our Coffee Chat Saturday series.

Also, we’ll list the information and resources available to you during the break out rooms portion of the event. 

To include, resume overview, general networking, tech preparation info and much more.

Round Robin:

This is your time to advocate for yourself and what you hope to gain from this experience, the floor is yours!

For example, pitch yourself and or services. Looking for work? Tell the group what industry you're looking to learn more about. 

This is your time, take advantage of it!

Breakout Rooms:

Following the group portion, you’ll have the opportunity to break off and meet everyone individually or in small groups.

You will also have the option to remain in main room, where questions will be answered pertaining to Tech, Education, Entrepreneurship & whatever questions you may have.

Thank you and we hope to see you there!
