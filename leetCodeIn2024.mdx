# When Will The Suffering End?
<Video id="i-RCKlC-DYk" />

Let me guess, you're probably wondering if the thousands of hours it takes to be good at something is even worth your time at all? Well, of course it is. If you're new to Tech, learning daily to solve problems is just another day in the life!

## Cheer Up.

I hear quite often, "leetcode will never actually be used on the job and this is just a waste of time!", let's delve into that train of thought shall we?

As stated, on the day to day, we easily encounter many real world issues in Development and even more costly ones in Production. As a team, we rely on each other to collaborate and work together through tough moments to reach a universal goal. At a minimum, we're all expected to be at least some degree brilliant as Engineers and the ability to properly showcase/lead our train of thought will elevate everyone involved.

### I Agree.

Yeah, you as an individual, probably won't be asked to build complex Data Structures / implement the System Design for large organizations, but maybe one day you will? 

### Buckle Down.

In addition, leetcode definitely will force you to recall on language specific intricacies to find possible solutions. Thus, helping you stay sharp and become a better developer over time. 

That isn't so bad is it? 

### Question.

In a highly competitive market looming with Tech layoffs left and right, what are you doing to stay in demand?
