### Tips For New Perfomers:

1. Practice Regularly: Regular practice is essential for improving your musical skills and confidence as a performer. Set aside dedicated time each day to practice your instrument and rehearse your songs.

2. Start Small: Begin by performing at local open mic nights, small venues, or house concerts to gain experience and confidence onstage. Starting small allows you to hone your craft in front of smaller, more intimate audiences before tackling larger venues or events.

3. Build a Repertoire: Develop a diverse repertoire of songs that showcase your musical abilities and style. Include a mix of original songs and cover songs that resonate with your audience.

4. Engage with Your Audience: Interact with your audience between songs, share stories or anecdotes, and make eye contact to establish a connection. Engaging with your audience helps create a memorable and enjoyable experience for both you and your listeners.

5. Stage Presence: Work on your stage presence and performance skills to captivate your audience and hold their attention. Experiment with movement, gestures, and facial expressions to convey emotion and energy during your performances.

6. Prepare for Performances: Before each performance, make sure you're well-prepared by practicing your songs, tuning your instruments, and checking your equipment. Arrive early to soundcheck and familiarize yourself with the venue.

7. Manage Stage Fright: It's normal to feel nervous before performing, but learning to manage stage fright is essential for delivering a confident and polished performance. Practice relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or visualization, to calm your nerves before taking the stage.

8. Seek Feedback: Solicit feedback from friends, family, fellow musicians, and audience members to gain valuable insights into your performances. Constructive criticism can help you identify areas for improvement and refine your skills as a performer.

9. Network and Collaborate: Build relationships with other musicians, promoters, venue owners, and industry professionals to expand your network and create opportunities for collaboration and performance. Networking can also help you book gigs and grow your fanbase.

10. Stay Persistent and Positive: Building a career as a musician takes time, effort, and perseverance. Stay persistent in pursuing your goals, and maintain a positive attitude even in the face of challenges or setbacks. Celebrate your successes, no matter how small, and keep pushing forward towards your dreams.

By following these tips and staying dedicated to your craft, you can become a confident and successful performer and make a lasting impression on your audience.
