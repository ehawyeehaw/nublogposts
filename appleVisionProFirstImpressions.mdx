# Welcome to the Future?

<Video id="i-tjPmjq-CM" />

## Apple Vision Pro First Impressions

Wow! Is the future truly here? After my Apple Vision Pro demo, I can definitely say I am feeling more open to the possibilities of a new world. My first few seconds reminded me of my first Ipod Shuffle, Ipod Nano, Macbook, Iphone and the list goes on lol.

Initially, my thoughts began to wander to all the possible edge cases this product would be suitable for. Which directions could this possibly go in? 

### Edge Cases:
- Education (Immersive learning will aid visual learners so much more!)
- Sports (Now you can sit courtside/fieldside for big games!)
- Movies (Imagine being apart of your favorite action films!)
- Software Development (This could change how we build software in real time!)

So many more to look forward to and it has honestly inspired me to sharpen up on my Swift programming / Unity / Unreal Engine skills.

### Unintended Consequences?

Whenever I examine a new product or idea, I can always hear my old Economics professor yelling, "Beware of unintended consequences!!". As a very cynical programmer, it is quite easy for me to imagine what can go wrong. We could easily be setting the stage for a new dystopian series or Sci Fi film, which I'm not against lol!

Even so, I'm very excited for what the future holds in the realm of Spacial Computing. Besides, Apple is going to have to make their price pretty accessible for this to reach every home in the world.

Until then. . .
