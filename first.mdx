## Howdy Angelenos!

"So what is this non-sense you're on about?" Gremolina, an Event Platform where you can post, share, and connect with others in your area. Born out of necessity and after spending years at home, it's time to get out and live life! Los Angeles is filled with so many activities and functions, that it can be tough to navigate. We here at Gremolina aim to provide Angelenos with a platform to discover a variety of events happening across different neighborhoods and of all types. Have a backyard metal show? Chess club function? Jazz band ensemble? Save a tree and post that flyer on Gremolina instead! 

Thank you and we can't wait to share Gremolina with you all.
