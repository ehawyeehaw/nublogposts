Emperor is a Norwegian black metal band formed in 1991 in Notodden by guitarist and vocalist Ihsahn (Vegard Sverre Tveitan), guitarist Samoth (Tomas Thormodsæter Haugen), and drummer Faust (Bård Eithun). The band is known for its pioneering role in the Norwegian black metal scene and is considered one of the most influential bands in the genre.

Emperor's music is characterized by its symphonic and atmospheric elements, aggressive guitar riffs, intricate melodies, and complex song structures. Their lyrical themes often explore topics such as Norse mythology, darkness, and anti-Christianity.

The band released their debut album, "In the Nightside Eclipse," in 1994, which received critical acclaim and is widely regarded as a classic in the black metal genre. This album helped establish Emperor as a leading force in the Norwegian black metal scene.

Throughout their career, Emperor released several highly acclaimed albums, including "Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk" (1997), "IX Equilibrium" (1999), and "Prometheus: The Discipline of Fire & Demise" (2001). Each album showcased the band's musical evolution and innovative approach to black metal.

In addition to their studio albums, Emperor is known for their intense and theatrical live performances, which often feature elaborate stage sets and costumes. The band has toured extensively around the world and has gained a dedicated fan base worldwide.

Although Emperor disbanded in 2001, they reunited for a series of live performances and festival appearances in the years following their breakup. Despite occasional hiatuses, Emperor's influence on the black metal genre remains profound, and their music continues to inspire and captivate audiences around the globe.
