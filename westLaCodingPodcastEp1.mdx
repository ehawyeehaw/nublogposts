## Hello World!

<Video id="ZRYXeX4P9EE" />

West LA Coding is a Southern California Tech Community dedicated to Computer Science education, Networking, Social Mixers, LeetCode and more! 

In this first episode, I delve into why we exist as a group and a bit more about myself, the founder of this group. 

I'm Chris Jaramillo, or CJ for short, and I have a cavalier attitude towards life and much to do with my time serving in the US Navy. After spending time with the Naval Special Warfare community and going to Rescue Swimmer School myself, I'd learned that anything is possible with grit and perseverance. That mindset has been applied to my self taught developer journey and has definitely helped me handle some of the tough moments throughout my past and current life as a Software Engineer. 

Also, I'm the Founder of Gremolina. An event platform where you can post, share and connect with others in your area. Coming soon to Los Angeles for Web, IOS and Android. It is my goal to cover an array of topics between Computer Science education, Entrepreneurship in Tech, Motivation and so much more.

Thank you for checking out the first episode and stay tuned for more!
