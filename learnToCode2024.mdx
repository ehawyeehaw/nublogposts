# Will AI replace Software Developers? 

<Video id="AL7lEr2K5dM" />

I'm sure you've heard the sentiment countless times by now, that soon Software Developers will become obsolete and replaced by AI. You know, I can't deny the impressive growth and new wave of AI, however, I feel that straying away from analog solutions is just not practical.

With that in mind, I've reflected a bit on my own programming journey and thought about how I'd approach it present day. To provide some context, I was the kid that grew up on Windows 95 and sat there in awe as the electronic world evolved. That led me to study Computer Science in High School, where I was hit with the wave of the most dryest text ever. I'd felt I was living the cliche of falling asleep in school learning about binary and low level code, although, necessary for when I'd later approach the topics over a decade later.

## Hello World? (again)

Life had indeed taken me several directions since my first experiences with programming, all around the world actually. With my military service and college wrapping up (Business Major), I'd realized I'd wanted to reopen the chapter from many moons ago. At that point, a wildly different experience than I remember. Previously, there weren't many ways to learn other than through texts and educational institutions. But, I had just finished college and the pandemic had just begun to shut down the world.

### What now?

I did what any self taught developer would do, I downloaded VS Code, pulled up some tutorials, gathered some docs and said let's do this! 

Here's the order of what languages/frameworks I'd learned and I'll follow up with how I'd approach this list present day.

1. Python (I wanted to be a scientific programmer / AI / fancy cliche stuff)
2. C (Like everyone else, I did Harvard CS50)
3. HTML (At some point I'd realized I needed to render things lol)
4. CSS (Wow I did not enjoy this at first)
5. JavaScript (I definitely did not enjoy this at the time)
6. React (Wow this made me completely forgive JavaScript lol)
7. NextJs (Makes React even better)
8. TypeScript (Wow feels like C)
9. C++ (Embedded Systems began to call my name, as well as, competitive programming)
10. React Native (Mobile Development is fun)
11. Swift (Apple has won me over lol)

Ok, so a long list which, I'm sure can be filled in with many more that I don't use as frequently or essential to what I do daily.

### How I'd reapproach my programming languages!

1. C (Harp down on the fundamentals, they do matter)
2. C++ (Continue with prev learnings and get competitive, appreciate STL)
3. HTML (The root of all rendering)
4. CSS (Ugh still painful lol)
5. JavaScript (Very useful and so in demand)
6. TypeScript (An industry standard, learn it well)
7. React (or any rendering library/framework)
8. React Native (Mobile is definitely not going away)
9. Swift (Specialization is always a plus)

I know that these may be some what vague descriptions of the languages/frameworks themselves, however, I plan to delve more specifically into topics in the near future.

I hope that this has helped you in your journey, whether your a beginner, intermediate, or just curious about another perspective in Tech.
